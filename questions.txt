0.  TODO - What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
    Is the longest word in this problem set's dictionary
    
1.  TODO - According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
    returns resource usage measures for who
    
2.  TODO - Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
    16
    
3.  TODO - Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
    Because C requires passing structs by reference in functions, because by value, the size would be too big

4.  TODO - Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, 
    convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
    It's reading the characters in the file character by character. When it's only alphabetical characters and apostrophes, append 
    the character to the word[] array until it is not a alphabetical characters or apostrophes but index is larger than 0 which means
    already found a whole word. If the word becomes larger than what defined as the largest word possible, the word is
    ignored. If the word has a digit, it is ignored as well.

5.  TODO - Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string
    like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
    To account for numerical inputs and other punctuation which we have deemed invalid.
    
6.  TODO - Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    Because word LENGTH and DICTIONARY are # declared as constants
